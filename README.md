- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Alicia (I use the nickname "Aikyu" online). I live in Brussels, and I am currently studying Business Computing / CS at college. 
I would love to make a career as a Software Developer or as a Web Developer later on. Two broadly different specializations, I know -- but I'm still figuring out which one I prefer the most !
- Other than coding, I love to draw, read and write in my spare time. I'm also addicted to music.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Java, SQL and HTML/CSS/JS. I also have some Python knowledge thanks to a first year in Computer Science at university.
- How to reach me :
For business inquiries/ any formal demand : boltryk.alicia@gmail.com <br>
For a more casual talk, you can reach me on discord : Aikyu#0110
